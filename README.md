- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeoXVIII
- 👀 I’m interested making a positive change for the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my CCNA cert and CySA cert.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects that can help me learn/practice coding, as I am not a programmer but am interested in knowing and understanding.
